Fork of the great Styles&Stylesheets Radiant CMS extension
from http://github.com/SwankInnovations/radiant-sns-extension

This adds Less ( http://lesscss.org ) functionality to your
regular stylesheets, allowing you to use variables, mixins and so on..
( see Less docs for further info )

It works like an original SnS extension but now you can use Less
in your stylesheets and it'll get 'compiled' - 'on-the-fly'.

Downside: it gets 'compiled' - 'on-the-fly', so if you have, like a zillion
lines of less code - probably it's better to just go and compile it by hand
and then paste it as you'd usually do..

BUT: for development time - it definitely get's you to do your job much quicker..

Any questiones?
